===============

I want to put an String on a .jpg file using java.

I want read .xlsx files and .txt files to get the content of this.
To read from an excel file I'm goin to use the  libraries of Apache-Poi 
and the xmlbeans. All this I'm import to the package.

To continue the development of this proyect you need have this package
in your workspace.

For Apache Poi you can download here:

http://poi.apache.org/download.html

For XmlBeans:

http://www.us.apache.org/dist/xmlbeans/binaries/

You only need download a file and import the libraries.

It's advisable that you install the package complete and path the 
libraries.

For the content on the excel file, I whis the contend stay like this
number|name of an student [delimited by a '*' char] like in the 
.xlsx file in the src directory.

But you can change all the lines of this proyect to adap from you needs, I try
to comment all the methods to make more easy. But this is not necessarily true 
this statement.

For this proyect I'm use eclipse.
